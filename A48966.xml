         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the French Church at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> which now craveth Your Royal and Favorable Audience: And I bring along with me to it, all the Hearts and all the Vows of thoſe of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who help to compoſe that Body.</p>
            <p>As I have the honor uſually to ſpeak on their behalf to GOD; ſo have they given me the honorable Commiſſion to ſpeak this day in their Names to His VICEGERENT, one of the moſt Auguſt Lieutenants of the DIVINE MAJESTY, whereof <hi>Yours</hi> is a moſt living Character. Neither was it poſſible (SIRE)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64447:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 49 -->to be ſilent, where there is ſo great cauſe to ſpeak, conſidering the freſh Teſtimony of Your moſt Royal Bounty, which we have ſo lately received by Your Majeſties Declaration in favour of our Nation, whereby You are pleaſed to ſuffer their abode in Your Dominions, under the ſhadow and protection of Your own Throne. How could we forbear after this ſurprizing GRACE, and extraordinary FAVOUR, at the leaſt to evidence in ſome meaſure unto Your Sacred Majeſty, what our Hearts are big with on this eminent Occaſion; and in this Important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, to teſtifie ſome part of our Duty and Acknowledgments? Which (SIRE) are ſo full, that we cannot poſſibly produce them all together, nor in their reall extents, for they looſe conſiderably whileſt they are riſing from our Hearts but to our Lips, ſuch are our tranſports and our joyes within.</p>
            <p>Each good French-man within Your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, is doubtleſs full of this ſenſe, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch whom You permit here to enjoy the greateſt and moſt deare of all Intereſts, and to be as it were linked unto Your own Crown, by the Sacred tyes of Religion, and by the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy of the ſame FAITH. But (GREAT SIR) ſuffer us, we beſeech You, to preſume that our Church and Congregation may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a Right for her particular Application upon the occaſion of this Your General De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration; and that ſhe ought to behold it with an Eye and Light much differing from the reſt of the French; and that diſcerning therein a more eſpecial concernment and intereſt, ſhe hath with reaſon impoſed on her ſelf a more ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar way of acknowledgment.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64447:3"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 49 -->
            <p>No doubt (SIRE) but all Men will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve no leſs then we do, an infinite <hi>Charity</hi> in this Your moſt Prudent Declaration: All Strangers, Your generous <hi>Hoſpitality;</hi> And all <hi>French,</hi> an incomparable <hi>Generoſity.</hi> The wiſe and knowing, will admire in it Your wonderful penetrating Spirit, as well as Your preventive Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which foils and diſappoints all the pernicious deſigns of that of Your Enemies, who muſt now be obliged to confeſs, That Your Majeſty under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the Art of Reigning in our Hearts, and hath found out an infallible way how to make good Subjects of Natural <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> even while they remain ſuch. Certainly all Chriſtendom will diſcover in every part of it, the perfect <hi>Genius</hi> of Chriſtianity, and will be ſurprized to ſee the Spirit of Peace, thus reigning in a Declaration of War. All of the Proteſtant Profeſſion may learn by it; that Your Majeſty doth indeed conſider Your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Title of DEFENDER OF THE FAITH, as the moſt beautiful Flower of Your <hi>Diadem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They muſt conſider You, Great Sir, from <hi>All the ends of the Earth,</hi> where Divine Providence hath placed them, as the Supream Head of the Reformed World, as the Angel of the Church, and the Light of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And eſpecially the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of our Nation, who remain within Your Majeſties Dominions, and have embraced with us the Reformation, and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have already, doubtleſs, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſatisfaction obſerved, in this Your Majeſties Declaration (or rather Oracle) all the Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Piety, Prudence, and Moderation, which every day they ſo earneſtly pray to GOD for upon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64447:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 50 -->Your Majeſty, in their holy Prayers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.</p>
            <p>Permit us (SIRE) to repeat it once again, but in few words, leſt we abuſe Your Royal Patience; That our Church upon this occaſion enters into further and more particular thoughts and reflections; and that ſhe enjoys the taſte of this Your Majeſties benignity, with more delight and ſweetneſs, then the reſt of the <hi>French,</hi> who have it common with us, becauſe it is a Church which hath the honor to be Your own Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, and ows its Eſtabliſhment and Subſiſtence to Your Self.</p>
            <p>She looks upon You (GREAT SIR) as her Founder and <hi>Patriarch.</hi> It was Your Majeſty, that like another <hi>Apollo,</hi> did fix this floating Iſland; You provided <hi>reſt</hi> for this <hi>Ark,</hi> and when we have the Bleſſing there to preſent our ſelves frequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne of Grace, we remember, that it is evermore under the bleſſed ſhadow and auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious protection of that of Your Majeſtie. Therefore as this Church hath been confirmed in her firſt Priviledges by that Your Majeſties wiſe, Chriſtian, and Proteſtant Declaration; and that withal, Your Majeſty doth thereby ſuſtain her, even when in appearance ſhe was at the point to fall; and that ſome were prone to believe, that the very Intereſts of State required her entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;</p>
            <p>Is it not ſo (moſt Gracious Soveraign) that ſhe is under a double Obligement to Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty for her conſervation and ſettlement? And that You are now, as it were, a ſecond time her <hi>Founder</hi> and her <hi>Father?</hi> And that therefore, albeit the Oracle, by which ſhe ſubſiſts ſtill, were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64447:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 50 -->pronounced in behalf of all the <hi>French,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears how much more eſpecially it touches and concerns thoſe Members, out of which her Body is framed? And it is alſo moſt evident and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That our Acknowledgments ought to be, and are much more ſtrong and paſſionate then thoſe of others.</p>
            <p>But (Gracious Sir) what is there we can do, that may in any meaſure expreſs it? We have nothing but faint words, and uſeleſs thanks to preſent You with, for that Royal Word (in the terms of Your own Declaration) for that great and ſaving Word iſſued from the Royal Mouth of our <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in favor of all our Tribe. Such yet as they are, theſe thanks, theſe words, we are bold to offer them to Your Majeſty, as we do moſt humbly; as ſincere, as faithful, as true, as are the words of the Soul it ſelf, her thoughts and motions.</p>
            <p>In this ſort onely it is, that we preſume to tell Your Sacred Majeſty, (though in terms, it may be, like Hearts filled with Zeal and Submiſſion) that we render You Declaration for Declaration; and that we think we can not better anſwer that which Your Majeſty hath been pleaſed to publiſh in our Favor, then by that we now make to Your Majeſty; which is, That we ſhall never ceaſe to have for Your Majeſty, all the Loyalty and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, all the tenderneſs, zeal, and utmoſt duty, which the moſt humble, moſt obedient, and moſt faithful of all Your Majeſties Subjects and Servants do ow You.</p>
